# Movement_Arm
Built an IC that can potentially move a mechanical arm to a given target position. 
It can then extend and grab objects and retract when specificied and also will notify the user through and LED lights if it is made to move with its arm extended, which will remain until the arm is fully retracted. 

# How it was made
Created using VHDL utilizing logic gates, latches, and a mealy machine for various subcomponent operations
